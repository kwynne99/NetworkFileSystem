# NetworkFileSystem
Multiple Client NFS hosted on a server.

To start this NFS will be hosted on a single server. Clients can access the server, and one on the server it will act like it is a local file directory. Commands such as ls, mkdir, touch, can be used to read and write to files on the server. Additional functionality and features will be added on as we go.
